### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on setting up a Bitcoin Lightning Network node.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with how to prove we are all living in a simulation.
- 💬 Ask me about how Bitcoin will replace the US Dollar as the global reserve currency
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me on Twitter; https://twitter.com/BradSats
- ⚡ Fun fact: there will never be more than 21 million BTC.  Actually much less will ever be in circulation because many have already been lost permanently.
