### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on setting up a Bitcoin Lightning Network node.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to prove we are all living in a simulation.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how Bitcoin will replace the US Dollar as the global reserve currency
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me a DM on nostr.  My pubkey is npub1yfg8mkxn8tpvk7cduaycey4w02980kcs7tnu6z0yxs6368dvn3xq8fuaqr
- âš¡ Fun fact: there will never be more than 21 million BTC.  Actually much less will ever be in circulation because many have already been lost permanently.
