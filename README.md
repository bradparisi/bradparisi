- 💬 Ask me about how Bitcoin will replace the US Dollar as the global reserve currency
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a DM on nostr.  My pubkey is npub1sats9aewrxlw57z5477ylnhhrf07vdrsjm5as3z52t4fz3c7lldqu6lgex
- ⚡ Fun fact: there will never be more than 21 million BTC.  Actually much less will ever be in circulation because many have already been lost permanently.
